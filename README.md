# Comics Calendar - React Native

**The application is ready for use but unfortunately copyright issues prevent us from publishing it on Apple and Android stores.**
Following this problem and the inability to use the app in production, the comics database will no longer be updated.

Comics Calendar is a mobile app allowing to choose the comics series (only in french) you follow and buy every month and tick them off your list once you buy them. Preventing you from buying the same comics twice and having to stay informed about new comics getting released.
